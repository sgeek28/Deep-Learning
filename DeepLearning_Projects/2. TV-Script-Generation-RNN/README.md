# Generate TV Scripts
`TV Script generation` project 

Introduction
In this project, you'll generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new, "fake" TV script.

Getting the project files
The project files can be found in my public GitHub repo, in the project-tv-script-generation folder. You can download the files from there, but it's better to clone the repository to your computer.
