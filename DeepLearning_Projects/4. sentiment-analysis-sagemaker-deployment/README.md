# Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model

## Project Overview

In this project, I have used Amazon SageMaker to complete an entire lifecycle of a machine learning project. The goal is to build a very simple web page in which a user can submit a movie review and the prediction model behind the scenes will predict whether it is Positive or Negative review. The prediction model is implemented using Pytorch framework and trainned on IMDB dataset.
